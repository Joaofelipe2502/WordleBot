# WordleBot
Gets the "best guess" for the game wordle. Built in python & not optimized, it's slow, really slow. 
WordleList.txt contains all valid guesses, while answer_list.txt contains all valid answers. Both files are necessary to run
Follow the instructions after running main.py, it should walk you through the options on how to use
This was made as a novelty for my use only, while I tried to make it usable, documentation and proper errors will be lacking

NOT the optimal aproach mathematically -
This minimizes the expected number of valid words remaining after a guess, it does NOT minimize number guesses, even if these 2 are correlated.
